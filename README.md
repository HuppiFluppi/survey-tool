## Overview
Survey Tool abstracts survey/quiz definition through a declarative configuration in yaml.

The idea goes back some years when I was tasked to create a quiz for visitors of a job fair.
We wanted to offer a programming quiz at our booth that applicants could fill out to show their skills and win prizes.
As a bonus, we were able to contact the top scorers for possible job offers.

While I quickly thought about creating this as a Kotlin Compose app, I was missing the time back then to do it.
Instead, I went with a different (quick and dirty) approach at the time.
Now I came back to create this tool to try out Compose Multiplatform and learn something new. 
And maybe help others who come across this repo, having the same need I had years ago.

## Features
- Declarative survey/quiz configuration
- Support for multiple pages
- Support for different survey questions (Text, Multiple Choice, Rating, Likert)
- Quizzes with points and optional leaderboard
- Currently supports Desktop

## Tech stack
- Kotlin: 2.2 / JVM 21
- Build system: Gradle (Kotlin DSL)
- UI: Jetpack Compose (Android) or Compose Multiplatform

## Quick Start

Steps to use:

1) Define a survey configuration
- Check the [template](template.yaml) for a documented configuration
- Check the [examples folder](examples) for different kind of survey and quiz configurations
- Add questions to your like
- Configure settings as needed

2) Run the survey
- Run the survey tool
- Load the survey configuration

## Scoring & Leaderboard
- Scoring is optional and typically enabled for quiz-type surveys.
- Points must be configured per question.
- Leaderboard can be configured to display scores.

## Roadmap

## Development

### Flow & State of loaded survey
- Initial: Summary (overview with metadata and actions)
- Start: Transition into the first content page
- Advance: Move to the next page until completion
- Cancel: Return to the summary at any time

The model tracks:
- Survey metadata (title, type, page count)
- Current page and total progress
- Page content and optional per-question score visibility
- Leaderboard configuration (if enabled)

### Build
Gradle tasks:
- Build: `./gradlew assemble`
- Run (Desktop): `./gradlew run`

### Test
- Unit tests: `./gradlew test`
- Lint/Static analysis: Use your preferred tools (e.g., IDE inspections, Detekt, Ktlint)
- Consider CI integration to enforce checks
